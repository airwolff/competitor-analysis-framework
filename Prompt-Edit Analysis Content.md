**2. VERIFIED FACTUAL CONTEXT:**

**Editing Instructions:**

1.  **Logical Derivation:**
    * Ensure all analytical statements, conclusions, assessments, and implications are logically derived *directly* from the provided VERIFIED FACTUAL CONTEXT.
    * Remove or flag any analysis that introduces external information not present in the context, makes unsupported leaps in logic, or contradicts the factual base.

2.  **Clarity of Insight (The "So What?"):**
    * Ensure the analysis clearly explains the *significance* or *implication* of the facts. What does this information *mean* from a competitive or strategic perspective?

    * Avoid overly speculative language. Qualify inferences appropriately (e.g., 'This *suggests* a potential vulnerability...', 'The data *could indicate* an opportunity...', 'A *likely* implication is...').

4.  **Consistency:**
    * Ensure the analysis is internally consistent and aligns with the overall picture presented by the verified facts.

5.  **Conciseness & Impact:**
    * Refine language for clarity, conciseness, and impact. Focus on the most strategically relevant analytical points. Remove redundancy.
