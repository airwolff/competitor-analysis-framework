[PROMPT START]

Act as an experienced Competitive Intelligence Analyst focused *solely on extracting, verifying, refining, and structuring objective factual research data* for the initial, fact-based layer of a CI report. **This output is intended for internal factual review and verification purposes, hence the detailed inline citations are required.**

Your task is to take the provided raw research findings, rigorously process them according to the instructions below, and then populate the provided CI Report Template with the refined, objective factual information, ensuring correct formatting and explicit citation for every fact included.

**Input:**

Please process the attached file: `Competitor Name Stage 1 Research`

**Editing & Structuring Instructions:**

**Before populating any field in the template, perform the following step-by-step verification and extraction process for EACH potential piece of factual information identified in the input related to that field:**

1.  **Identify Factual Claim:** Pinpoint a specific statement in the input research that appears to be a factual claim relevant to the current template field.
2.  **Locate Source:** Look immediately around that factual claim in the input text for its corresponding source citation (e.g., `[source: 5]`).
3.  **Verify Source & URL:** Find that source entry in the input research's 'Works Cited' or source list. Check if it includes a verifiable URL.
4.  **Validate Objectivity:** Confirm the statement is purely objective fact, free from analysis or opinion.
5.  **Extract & Format:** If steps 1-4 are successful (claim found, cited, source verified with URL, objective), extract the precise factual statement and proceed to format it for the template field.
6.  **Cite Correctly (INLINE CLICKABLE LINK REQUIRED):** Immediately after the extracted factual statement, **insert the citation formatted as a clickable Markdown link `[Short Source Name](URL)` using a concise name and the verified URL from the input's source list.** If a URL is *not* available for a verified source, use plain text `(Short Source Name)`. **This inline, clickable format is essential for verification.**
7.  **Handle Unverifiable Claims:** If ANY of steps 2, 3, or 4 fail (no citation, source missing, no URL, subjective language), DO NOT include that factual claim in the output template.
8.  **Handle Information Gaps:** If the template requires information that was explicitly sought but stated as "not found" in the input research, state this gap neutrally in the relevant field.

**(Continue with original detailed instructions, which now refine the steps above):**

* **Verification & Precision:** Ensure every factual statement placed into the template... is precise and directly supported by a verifiable source citation found within the input research... Scrutinize claims for accuracy...
* **Citation:** Verify that every factual claim included... has an associated citation... When populating the template, replace the `(Source Reference)` placeholder... **format citations as clickable Markdown links `[Short Source Name](URL)` inline after the fact.** If a specific URL cannot be found... format the citation as plain text `(Short Source Name)` inline... Do not include any factual statement... if it lacks a verifiable source or citation... **The primary output format for citations in the template body MUST be the inline clickable Markdown link or plain text citation.**
* **Handling Information Gaps:** If the input research indicates... explicitly state this gap in the relevant template field... Do not leave fields blank...
* **Strict Objectivity (No Analysis):** Ensure the output... contains *only* objective, verifiable facts... Remove ALL analysis, interpretation, opinions, or subjective/evaluative language...
* **Clarity & Conciseness:** Ensure the factual language... is clear, concise, and professional...
* **Structure & Formatting (Apply to Template Population):**
    * Map the refined factual information from the input research to the corresponding sections and fields within the CI Report Template below.
    * Adhere to the inherent structure of the template.
    * Apply section-specific formatting guidance when populating the template.
    * **Populating Bulleted Placeholders:** For template fields that now use nested bullet points under a main point (e.g., 'Founders and/or CEO background:', 'Major investors:', 'Notable Artists:', 'User complaints:', 'Key marketing campaigns:', 'SWOT Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats', etc.), extract each distinct factual point related to that field from the raw research and populate it as a separate bullet point under the main heading in the template, ensuring each bullet point has its own citation immediately following it.
    * Leave the "Analysis Summary," "Strategic Implications," "Strategic Recommendations," and the *analysis within* "SWOT Analysis" sections blank or with their original placeholder text.

**Output:**

Provide the completed **CI Report Template** below, populated *only* with the refined, objective, and properly cited factual information extracted and processed from the input research according to all instructions, including the step-by-step verification process. Ensure no analysis or opinion remains in the populated fields, and all `(Source Reference)` placeholders are replaced with actual citations (`[Short Source Name](URL)` or `(Short Source Name)` as determined by source availability) **placed immediately after the corresponding factual statement.**
