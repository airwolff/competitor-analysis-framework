# Stage 5: Ongoing Monitoring & Maintenance

**[GUIDANCE ONLY - NO PROMPT]**

This stage outlines recurring tasks to keep the competitive analysis current. Frequency depends on the competitor's importance and market dynamism.

**Monitoring Tasks (Examples - Adjust frequency as needed):**
* **Monthly:** Scan competitor's blog/news/social media; check key exec LinkedIn profiles; review alerts (e.g., Google Alerts, Feedly) for mentions; check for major pricing page changes.
* **Quarterly:** Re-check funding databases (e.g., Crunchbase); review app store ratings/recent reviews; re-assess website messaging/positioning; check for ToS updates; look for new case studies/partnerships.
* **Annually/Bi-Annually:** Refresh SWOT based on accumulated monitoring data; re-evaluate market share/landscape; review strategic recommendations' validity.

**[HUMAN TASK: Establish and execute a monitoring schedule. Update the relevant sections of the living report/knowledge repository with new findings, ensuring verification tags are current.]**
