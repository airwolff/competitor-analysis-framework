# Stage 4: SWOT Analysis & Strategic Recommendations

## Stage 4 Prompt

**[PROMPT START]**

**Role:** Act as a **senior Competitive Intelligence Analyst** synthesizing findings into a SWOT analysis, analyzing implications, and generating strategic recommendations for *our* company.

**Input Data:**

<<< --- PASTE THE FINAL CLEANED FACTUAL & ANALYSIS OUTPUT (FROM STAGE 3 ANALYSIS, PART 1.5) HERE --- >>>
*(This input should be the nearly complete structured report containing verified facts from Stages 1-3 AND integrated analysis summaries from Stages 1-3, but WITHOUT inline citations)*

<<< --- PASTE THE VERIFIED "CONTEXT FOR STAGE 4 (SWOT INPUTS)" BLOCK GENERATED FROM STAGE 3 ANALYSIS OUTPUT (PART 2) HERE --- >>>
*(This provides the synthesized S, W, O, T points)*

**Analysis Task:** Based **strictly** on the SWOT input context provided above for `[Competitor Name]` and the broader report context in the Input Data, perform the following:

**Part 1: Generate SWOT Analysis & Implications (Internal Process)**
* *Internally perform reasoning and self-critique for each point below, but DO NOT include the reasoning/critique steps in the final analysis text.*

1.  **Format SWOT Matrix:** Use the provided `CONTEXT FOR STAGE 4 (SWOT INPUTS)` to structure the S, W, O, T points clearly as lists under the appropriate headings (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
2.  **Generate Strategic Implications:** Analyze the interactions within the SWOT matrix points. Generate text analyzing:
    * How **Strengths** could translate to advantages or leverage **Opportunities**.
    * How **Weaknesses** create vulnerabilities, especially considering **Threats**.
    * Which **Opportunities** the competitor seems best/worst positioned to capture.
    * Which **Threats** pose the greatest risk.

**Part 2: Generate Strategic Recommendations & Monitoring (For Our Company - Internal Process)**
*(Note: These recommendations are initial hypotheses derived logically *solely* from the limited competitive data summarized in the SWOT context. They require significant strategic validation. **This part is generated separately and typically requires significant human refinement.**)*
* *Internally perform reasoning for each point below, but DO NOT include the reasoning steps in the final output block.*

1.  **Exploit Competitor Weaknesses:** Suggest 1-2 potential differentiating strategies for *our company* based on each key **Weakness**.
2.  **Leverage Market Opportunities:** Suggest 1-2 ways *our company* could potentially leverage each key **Opportunity** against the competitor.
3.  **Defend Against Competitor Strengths:** Suggest 1-2 potential defensive measures for *our company* regarding each key **Strength**.
4.  **Anticipate Competitive Responses:** Identify the most likely and impactful competitive responses [Competitor Name] might make (inherently speculative).
5.  **Identify Potential 'White Space':** Suggest 1-2 potential strategic 'white space' areas for *our company*.
6.  **Monitoring Priorities:** List 3-5 key monitoring priorities moving forward regarding [Competitor Name].
7.  **Information Gaps Impacting SWOT/Recommendations:** List points where lack of information significantly impacts the SWOT or recommendations.

**Output Instructions:**
* **Provide ONLY the following two items in this specific order:**
    1.  **Generated Stage 4 Analysis:** Present the formatted SWOT matrix (from Part 1, Section 1) under the heading `### SWOT Analysis:` and the Strategic Implications analysis (from Part 1, Section 2) under the heading `### Strategic Implications:`.
    2.  **Recommendations & Monitoring Block:** Combine the recommendations, anticipated responses, white space ideas, monitoring priorities, and information gaps generated in Part 2 into a distinct block, clearly labeled (e.g., `## Strategic Recommendations & Monitoring Priorities (For Our Company)`).
* **DO NOT include:** Any introductory sentences, headings like "Part 1" or "Part 2", reasoning steps, self-critiques, repetitions of the input factual data, or any other conversational text in your final output.

**[PROMPT END]**

*(Post-Stage Human Task: Review the generated SWOT/Implications and the separate Recommendations/Monitoring block. Manually integrate the verified SWOT/Implications into your main report file. Critically evaluate, refine, and decide how to use the separate Recommendations/Monitoring block.)*
