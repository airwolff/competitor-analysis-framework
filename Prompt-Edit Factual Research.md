**Input:**
`Subvert Stage 1 Research` attached

**Editing Instructions:**

1.  **Verification & Precision:**
    * Ensure every factual statement (e.g., founding date, funding amount, feature description, market share estimate, key personnel, pricing details, target audience description) is precise and directly supported by a verifiable source citation.
    * Scrutinize claims for accuracy based on common knowledge and the provided context.

2.  **Citation:**
    * Verify that every factual claim has an associated citation.
    * Format citations as clickable Markdown links `[Source Name](URL)` whenever a verifiable URL exists.
    * If a specific URL cannot be found for a cited source, revert the citation to plain text `(Source Name)`.
    * **Crucially: Remove any factual statement that lacks a verifiable source or citation.**

3.  **Handling Information Gaps:**
    * If specific information required by the profile structure was sought but not found, ensure this gap is explicitly stated using neutral language (e.g., "Specific team size not disclosed in verifiable sources," "Technology stack details unverified," "Market share data not publicly available").

4.  **Strict Objectivity (No Analysis):**
    * Ensure the output contains *only* objective, verifiable facts as reported by sources.
    * **Remove ALL analysis, interpretation, opinions, or subjective/evaluative language** (e.g., remove words like 'good', 'poor', 'impressive', 'limited', 'strong', 'weak' unless directly quoting a cited source). The goal is pure factual reporting.

5.  **Clarity & Conciseness:**
    * Ensure the factual language is clear, concise, and professional. Avoid jargon where possible.

6.  **Structure:**
    * Maintain the original structure of the research findings (e.g., Company Overview, Products/Services, etc.).

7.  **Factual Formatting (Apply section-specific guidance):**
    * **Company Overview Facts:** Keep factual and concise. The 'Brief product/service description' should be a factual, descriptive paragraph.
    * **Financial and Investment Details:** Format primarily as factual lists or figures (use bullet points). Use standard phrases for unavailable data.
    * **Team Composition Facts:** Use factual lists for names, roles, and key experience points (use bullet points).
    * **Products/Services Facts:** Use descriptive paragraphs for core offerings/tech summaries. Use bullet points for listing specific, distinct features, capabilities, or *reported* user/artist complaints (verbatim if possible, or summarized factually).
    * **Target Audience Facts:** Use clear descriptive paragraphs based on source findings.
    * **Pricing & Business Model Facts:** Use clear descriptions. Use bullet points or tables for detailing pricing tiers or commission structures.
    * **Market Positioning & Messaging Facts:** Use descriptive paragraphs for reported positioning/messaging. Use bullet points for listing specific differentiators or value propositions *as stated by the competitor or sources*.
    * **Marketing & Sales Strategy Facts:** Use descriptive paragraphs for reported strategy. Use bullet points for listing key channels, specific campaigns, or partnerships *as reported*.

**Output:**
Provide the edited and refined *factual research findings* below, adhering strictly to all instructions above. Ensure no analysis or opinion remains.
